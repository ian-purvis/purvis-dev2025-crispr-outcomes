# purvis-dev2025-crispr-outcomes

Purvis Dev 2025 CRISPR editing outcomes analysis. It uses the `CrispRVariants` package to analyze CRISPR editing outcomes from single- and paired-end sequencing data. Amplicon sequencing data is used to assess the efficiency of CRISPR editing at a specific target region in the mouse genome.

Data from this analysis is included in the following publication:

### Background
This project aims to analyze CRISPR editing outcomes using paired-end sequencing data. The `CrispRVariants` package is utilized to assess the efficiency of CRISPR editing at a specific target region in the mouse genome. The analysis will focus on identifying and quantifying indels (insertions and deletions) resulting from CRISPR editing for the revision of the A robust cis-regulatory network ensures Otx2 expression during retinal development manuscript.

### Hypothesis

CRISPR editing will result in a higher frequency of indels at the target region compared to non-target regions.

### Samples

  P0 mouse retina samples electroporated with CRISPR NHEJ expressing plasmid reagents targeting the Otx2 gene or enhancer regions

| sampleid     | prefix              | treatment |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| ControlDHS2  | ControlDHS2primers  | Control   |
| ControlDHS15 | ControlDHS15primers | Control   |
| TestDHS15    | TestDHS15primers    | Test      |


**guide RNA sequences used for CRISPR editing:**
  
DHS15 - g1 = GCTGCCCCAGCCTTTCACAA
DHS15 - g2 = TTTTCTTTTTTATTTAACCG
DHS2 - g1 = CACCGACCCAGCTCTGGCAGATGGG
DHS2 - g2 = ATTTTGAACCCCCTACAGAT

These sequences do not include the PAM sequence.

**amplicon information:**

For DHS15:
Amplicon size = 437 bp
Forward primer = GGTGTGCACCTCACCCGTGTTT
Reverse primer = CACATCAAGCTGGAGGGCTGCA

For DHS2:
Amplicon size = 638 bp
Forward primer = CCGAAGTGCCAGGAGGAAAGGC
Reverse primer = ACCAAACCACACCACACCACACC

## Analysis

- Process and align paired-end sequencing FASTQ files using `bwa` and `samtools`
- Use `CrispRVariants` to analyze CRISPR editing outcomes from the aligned BAM files
- Identify and quantify indels at the target region

### Notes

- mm39 genome build will be used for alignment
